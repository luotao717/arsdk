When configured as router, tspc used to generate an own radvd.conf
config file and to restart radvd with this configfile.
This is bad when the user already specified a radvd configuration.

Therefor, radvd handling in Debian's tspc is disabled.
Please create your own router advertisement configuration in /etc/radvd.conf
and everything is fine :)
