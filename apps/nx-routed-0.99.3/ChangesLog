   - Changed rip2sniff so it uses RAW socket. This way
     it doesn't interfere with routed and ppp links.
   - Timers: call_handler now unlinks timer before it calls it.
   - expire_routes now has only one timer that points to the route
     that will get expired first. It also gets changed along
     with route timeouts.

   - Interface routes now exist in the routing tables.
   - Bugs reduced.
   - Routes that expire, get propagated to all protocols.
   - New command line switch -p: Prints all debug and notice
     to syslog and stdout.
   - set_expire_timer repeatedly sets more and more timers; need
     to implement new timer code, so only one timer per route exists.

   - Implemented new timers code, should support from higher
     layers now
   - These new timers are completed now but tested, so the 
     repository is unstable

   - Route deletion process seemes to be working
   - Figured out how to make expiring timers more graceful.
     Use reference count on a timer. Reuse timers with
     timer_find() function.
   - Routes now have flags (RF_CHANGE, RF_UNREACH)
