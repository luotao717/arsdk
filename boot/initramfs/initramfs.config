# initramfs.config -- this is a configuration file to be used by
# the kernel to build it's compiled-in initramfs archive.
# The following sets up for use of inittrampoline, which will then
# find an external initramfs archive file and extract that into
# rootfs (file system buffer cache with no real file system).

# The following from (kernel tree) usr/initramfs_list
# I think we must have /dev/console available.
# Not sure if we need /root but we keep it just in case.
dir /dev 0755 0 0
nod /dev/console 0600 0 0 c 5 1
dir /root 0700 0 0

# inittrampoline needs /dev/mem in order to fetch archive file
nod /dev/mem     0600 0 0 c 1 1

# inittrampoline source path must be relative to the kernel source tree.
# This may need modification; it is set up assuming the current
# Atheros build tree layout.
# Caution: inittrampoline must be built BEFORE the kernel.
file /init ../../../boot/initramfs/inittrampoline 755 0 0

# CAUTION: Current Atheros make procedure fails to properly rebuild
# the kernel object file containing the initramfs.
# If you change either this file or change inittrampoline, be SURE
# to cd to linux/kernels/<kernel>/usr and remove generated files
# before building.
